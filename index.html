        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Lindsay, an easygoing individual with a passion for learning and creating. 
            Whether it's exploring the outdoors, diving into a good book, or experimenting in the kitchen, I take pleasure in the everyday. I'm a firm believer in finding joy in the simple things and embracing new experiences. 
            When I'm not pursuing my interests, I love connecting with people, engaging in lively conversations, and sharing a good laugh. Life's too short to take everything too seriously, so let's make the most of it and enjoy the journey together!</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <div>
            <h3><a href="https://iamalion.github.io/bird-survey/">Bird Survey</a></h3>
            <p class="stuff">This project was initially a concept from <a href=http://www.freeCodeCamp.org>freeCodeCamp</a>. I chose to do a survey on birds because they are so fun to observe and I wanted to know what other thought of them too!</p> <p>This project included:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Setting up a HTML page</li>
                <li>Styling with CSS</li>
                <li>At least a week of work</li>
                <li>Several White Claws</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://iamalion.github.io/animal-shelter/">Animal Shelter</a></h3>
            <p class="stuff">I made this animal shelter website in my first week of Epicodus. I used it to practice floats.</p>
            <p>The things I like most about this site are:</p>
            <ol class="ol">
                <li>The cute pictures</li>
                <li>The background image</li>
                <li><span class="fancy">Floof Nugget</span></li>
            </ol>

            <h3><a href="https://iamalion.github.io/resort-website/">Resort Website</a></h3>
            <p class="stuff">This was another Epicodus week 1 project. We were supposed to use it to practice branches in Git and GitHub, but my partner and I deviated from the main lesson.</p>
            <p>The hardest parts for me were:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Linking pages back and forth</li>
                <li>Getting it set up on GitHubPages</li>
                <li>Finding the right style</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>After graduating from the University of Utah, I embarked on an exciting professional journey that led me to Airbnb, where I dedicated a significant portion of my career. 
                During my time there, I honed my skills in customer service, management, and cross collaboration. After 10 fulfilling years and with the drive to challenge myself with new skills, 
                I have decided to make a career change and venture into the world of web development. It's an exciting transition that allows me to combine my creativity, problem-solving abilities, and love for technology. 
                I am excited to embrace this new path and leverage my past experiences to contribute meaningfully in this new field!</p>
